\section{Assumptions and Notations}

\subsection{Assumptions}

The following reasonable assumptions are made to reasonably simplify the model:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Government policies (such as taxes, subsidies, regulations, etc.) remain unchanged during the period of the model.
  \item No major event compromising or promoting the tourism industry will occur during the period of our model.
  \item Consumer behavior, consumer preferences, or market demand are assumed to remain unchanged.
  \item Consumption per visitor per day remains stable.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Notations}

The primary notations used in this paper are listed in Table 1.
